# Engine-B
Game Engine designed for Java beginners, looking for help while creating a game, but not too much help to the point where they don't learn anything. This game engine is specifically designed in order for the programmer to learn and practice programming concepts such as OOP, while also getting a little help. Engine-B (B for beginner), aims to help beginners create games while allowing them to learn and practice basic and complicated coding problem solving, while also boosting creativity.

# Why This Engine?
While game engines such as Unity are very good platforms to construct games, if one would like to delve deaper in to coding, Engine-B is a good place to start. Game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine, provide to many graphical tools that simplify the most basic of tasks. These are good tools to make the creator's life easier, however it may also leave a beginner making games, without understanding the basics of problem solving with code.

# Specialty
Engine-B is a game engine aimed at teaching beginners coding concepts. Unlike other graphical game engines such as Unity, Engine-B helps the creator, while also making sure they practice programming concepts and habits such as OOP. It also gives them a wide variety of knowledge in different Java keywords and methods-of-coding, because they do not get the help of easy graphical changes. However many still want to make a game, and therefore more complicated libraries are hidden in the game engine, with optional documentation, in case the creator would like to learn more aboout it.
